Fix for Failing Travis Builds

In the upcoming lecture we will be adding a script to our .travis.yml file. Due to a change in how the Jest library works with Create React App, we need to make a small modification:

    script:
      - docker run USERNAME/docker-react npm run test -- --coverage

instead should be:

    script:
      - docker run -e CI=true USERNAME/docker-react npm run test

You can read up on the CI=true variable here:

https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests#linux-macos-bash

and enviornment variables in Docker here:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables

Additionally, you may want to set the following property if your travis build fails with “rakefile not found” by adding to the top of your .travis.yml file:

    language: generic

Travis Script Fix for access_key_id

In the upcoming lecture we will be adding our AWS variables to the deploy script of the 
.travis.yml file. There is a slight change that will be required, otherwise you will get 
an error when Travis attempts to run your code:

    invalid option "--access_key_id="
    failed to deploy

The fix is add 'secure' to the access_key_id, similar to what we will do for the secret_access_key.

The code will now look like this:

    access_key_id:
      secure: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
